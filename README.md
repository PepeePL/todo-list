# todo-list
Simple todo CLI utility made for Linux with help of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/).\
 It's in early stage of development and could contain errors *(I hope not critical ones!)*.
## ✨ Features
- #### 🦀 Fast
    Program is written in Rust so it's incredibly fast.
- #### 🚀 Clean
    List your tasks with status in clean and readable way using todo list.\
    Example:
    ```
    Task list:
    1. Test ✅ finished!
    2. Finish this damn project ❎ TODO
- #### 🤓 User-friendly *//I think*
    Simple commands and no errors on half of the screen!
## 📔 Usage
`todo add <task>` - adds task to the list.\
`todo list` - prints task list.\
`todo remove <task number>` - removes task from list.\
`todo status <task number>` - toggles status between todo and finished.\
`todo help` - display help message.

2. Open terminal in the `todo` file location.
